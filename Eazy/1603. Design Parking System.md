### Question

https://leetcode.com/problems/design-parking-system/

Design a parking system for a parking lot. The parking lot has three kinds of parking spaces: big, medium, and small, with a fixed number of slots for each size.

Implement the ParkingSystem class:

ParkingSystem(int big, int medium, int small) Initializes object of the ParkingSystem class. The number of slots for each parking space are given as part of the constructor.
bool addCar(int carType) Checks whether there is a parking space of carType for the car that wants to get into the parking lot. carType can be of three kinds: big, medium, or small, which are represented by 1, 2, and 3 respectively. A car can only park in a parking space of its carType. If there is no space available, return false, else park the car in that size space and return true.

Example :

```md

Input
["ParkingSystem", "addCar", "addCar", "addCar", "addCar"]
[[1, 1, 0], [1], [2], [3], [1]]
Output
[null, true, true, false, false]

Explanation
ParkingSystem parkingSystem = new ParkingSystem(1, 1, 0);
parkingSystem.addCar(1); // return true because there is 1 available slot for a big car
parkingSystem.addCar(2); // return true because there is 1 available slot for a medium car
parkingSystem.addCar(3); // return false because there is no available slot for a small car
parkingSystem.addCar(1); // return false because there is no available slot for a big car. It is already occupied.

```

### My solution

```C#

public class ParkingSystem {
    //題目希望做一個停車系統，會記錄大、中、小車位是否足夠

    //大、中、小車位數量
    int big;
    int medium;
    int small;

    //停車系統，參數給大、中、小車位數量
    public ParkingSystem(int big, int medium, int small)
    {
        this.big = big;
        this.medium = medium;
        this.small = small;
    }

    //增加汽車，依據車大小更新車位數量，若沒位子傳回false，若有位子傳回true
    public bool AddCar(int carType)
    {
        if (carType == 1) { big -= 1; return this.big >= 0; }
        else if (carType == 2) { medium -= 1; return this.medium >= 0; }
        else { small -= 1; return this.small >= 0; }
    }
}

```
