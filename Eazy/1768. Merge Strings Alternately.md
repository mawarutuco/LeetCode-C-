### Question

https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-strings-alternately/description/

You are given two strings word1 and word2. Merge the strings by adding letters in alternating order, starting with word1. If a string is longer than the other, append the additional letters onto the end of the merged string.

Return the merged string.

Example :

```md

Input: word1 = "abc", word2 = "pqr"
Output: "apbqcr"
Explanation: The merged string will be merged as so:
word1:  a   b   c
word2:    p   q   r
merged: a p b q c r

Input: word1 = "ab", word2 = "pqrs"
Output: "apbqrs"
Explanation: Notice that as word2 is longer, "rs" is appended to the end.
word1:  a   b 
word2:    p   q   r   s
merged: a p b q   r   s

```

### My solution

```C#

public class Solution {
    public string MergeAlternately(string word1, string word2) {
      
    int len1 = word1.Length;
    int len2 = word2.Length;
    int len = (len1 > len2) ? len1 : len2;
    string ans = "";

    for (int i = 0; i < len; i++)
    {
        if (len1 > i) ans += word1[i];
        if (len2 > i) ans += word2[i];
    }

    Console.WriteLine(ans);  
    return ans;
    }
}

```
